title: Simple GitHub Tutorial
updated: 2024-11-12 08:58:00

I wrote a tutorial on Git (/posts/simple-git-tutorial). In this post, I'd like to introduce the platform that is indispensable when it comes to Git: GitHub.

<!--more-->

As mentioned in the article about Git, GitHub is a platform for hosting remote Git repositories. Think of it simply, but loosely, as a little cloud drive that you can use to sync (upload, download) your code and communicate with other developers.

> [!Note]
> If you encounter any problems, I recommend that you check [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/), use a search engine, or ask an AI assistant. Alternatively, you can contact me at [email](mailto:i@blocklune.cc).

## Creating a Github Account

See:

- _[Getting started with your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)_

## Checking your Local Git Config

Make sure that you have told Git your name and email. That is say, you should have run:

```bash
git config --global user.name YOUR_NAME
git config --global user.email YOUR_EMAIL
```

## Connecting to GitHub with SSH

You are recommended to connecting to GitHub with SSH (instead of HTTP/HTTPS).

First, generate a new SSH key using new ED25519 algorithm:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C YOUR_EMAIL
```

Then, Keep on repeating pressing `Enter` until your prompt appear again.

Finally, add your public key to GitHub:

1. Go to _[SSH and GPG keys - GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys)_.
2. Click the green `New SSH key` button at the top right of the page.
3. Fill out the form, where `key` is the content of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (This file is generated by the `ssh-keygen` command above. You may run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` on Linux or Mac or run `notepad ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` on Windows to check its content).
4. Submit the form by clicking the green `Add SSH key` button.

> [!Tip]
> The postfix `.pub` indicates that the `id_ed25519.pub` file is a public key. The `ssh-keygen` command above also generates a private key file `id_ed25519` (without the `.pub` postfix).

## Using SSH over the HTTPS port (Optional but Recommended)

Due to the special network environment in China, you may often need to use proxy service to get a better browsing experience. Generally, when you enable the `System Proxy` option, only the traffic on port 80/443 (corresponding to HTTP/HTTPS) will go through the proxy server, while the traffic on SSH's default port 22 will not. With the following settings, you can force SSH traffic to go to port 443.

To test if SSH over the HTTPS port is possible, run:

```bash
ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
```

Type `yes` if you see some info like:

```text
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

If you receive response like below, it means it's OK:

```text
Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
provide shell access.
```

You can now override your SSH settings to force any connection to GitHub.com to run through that server and port. Edit `~/.ssh/config` and add this section:

```text
Host github.com
    Hostname ssh.github.com
    Port 443
    User git
```

Now your usual command like:

```bash
git clone git@github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

is equivalent to:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

## Basic Concept & Usages

### Cloning

You can use `git clone` to clone an existing repo from GitHub. The simplest form looks like:

```bash
git clone URL [LOCAL_DIRECTORY_NAME]
```

where center brackets mean that `LOCAL_DIRECTORY_NAME` is optional.

> It's no longer recommended to use http/https url to clone. Using url like `git@github.com:YOUR-NAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git`!

If you want to specify a branch when cloning, you can use `-b` option:

```bash
git clone -b BRANCH URL
```

If you don't want to include all commits, you can use the `--depth` option. This is helpful when cloning a large repo (you don't need so many commits before actually).

```bash
git clone URL --depth=1
```

### Issues & Pull Requests

**Issues** and **Pull Requests (PR)** are two of the most important collaboration features on GitHub. With an Issue, you can point out problems with a codebase, suggest improvements, request new features, etc. With a Pull Request, you can ask the administrator of a codebase to merge your submitted code for the purpose of contributing to that codebase.

### GitHub Workflow
