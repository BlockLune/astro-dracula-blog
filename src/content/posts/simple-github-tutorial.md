I have posted a tutorial of Git (See _[Simple Git Tutorial](/posts/9363e311.html)_). But it mixed up using Git and using GitHub together. I post this new tutorial to draw a line and make things clear.

> Notice: If you run into any problems, it's highly recommended that you check out [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/), or Google it. If you still can't solve it, you can comment below this post.

## Creating a Github Account

See:

- _[Signing up for a new GitHub account - GitHub Docs](https://docs.GitHub.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-GitHub/signing-up-for-a-new-GitHub-accountt)_

## Checking your Local Git Config

Make sure that you have told Git your name and email. That is say, you should have run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "<your_name>"
git config --global user.email "<your_email@example.com>"
```

## Connecting to GitHub with SSH

You are recommended to connecting to GitHub with SSH (instead of HTTP/HTTPS).

First, generate a new SSH key using new ED25519 algorithm:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your_email@example.com>"
```

Then, Keep on repeating pressing `Enter` until your prompt appear again.

Finally, add your public key to GitHub:

1. Go to _[SSH and GPG keys - GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys)_.
2. Click the green `New SSH key` button at the top right of the page.
3. Fill out the form, where `key` is the content of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (This file is generated by the `ssh-keygen` command above. You may run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` on Linux or Mac or run `notepad ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` on Windows to check its content).
4. Submit the form by clicking the green `Add SSH key` button.

> The postfix `.pub` indicates that the `id_ed25519.pub` file is a public key. The `ssh-keygen` command above also generates a private key file `id_ed25519` (without the `.pub` postfix).

## Using SSH over the HTTPS port (Optional but Recommended)

Due to the special network environment in China, you may often need to use proxy service to get a better browsing experience. Generally, when you enable the `System Proxy` option, only the traffic on port 80/443 (corresponding to HTTP/HTTPS) will go through the proxy server, while the traffic on SSH's default port 22 will not. With the following settings, you can force SSH traffic to go to port 443.

To test if SSH over the HTTPS port is possible, run:

```bash
ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
```

Type `yes` if you see some info like:

```text
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

If you receive response like below, it means it's OK:

```text
Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
provide shell access.
```

You can now override your SSH settings to force any connection to GitHub.com to run through that server and port. Edit `~/.ssh/config` and add this section:

```text
Host github.com
    Hostname ssh.github.com
    Port 443
    User git
```

Now your usual command like:

```bash
git clone git@github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

is equivalent to:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

## GitHub Cli

TODO

## Basic Usages

### Cloning

You can use `git clone` to clone an existing repo from GitHub. The simplest form looks like:

```bash
git clone <url> [<local_directory_name>]
```

where center brackets mean that `<local_directory_name>` is optional.

> It's no longer recommended to use http/https url to clone. Using url like `git@github.com:YOUR-NAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git`!

If you want to specify a branch when cloning, you can use `-b` option:

```bash
git clone -b <branch> <url>
```

If you don't want to include all commits, you can use the `--depth` option. This is helpful when cloning a large repo (you don't need so many commits before actually).

```bash
git clone <url> --depth=1
```
