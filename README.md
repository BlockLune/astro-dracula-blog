## The Story

This is my fourth attempt at building a blog system. My journey began at the tender age of 14, when I first dabbled in creating a blog. I learned the basics of HTML in a junior high computer class, and furthered my knowledge through resources such as [doyoudo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1gp411f7j6). My first attempt at blogging was a simple static site created with HTML & CSS, no JavaScript, and hosted on GitHub Pages.

As I approached college, I experimented with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and the [Icarus](https://ppoffice.github.io/hexo-theme-icarus/) theme for my second blog. For the third iteration, I continued using Hexo, but this time with the [NexT](https://theme-next.js.org/) theme. Using a framework like Hexo greatly streamlines the blogging process, allowing me to focus on content creation. However, I have always felt the "weight" of using a framework.

Determined to create a blog that was truly my own, I decided to build one from the ground up. And here it is!

The blog is mainly built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [React](https://react.dev/) components. I chose Astro because it is super fast. The color scheme is inspired by [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/). I use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) for typography. And I do some animations with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).
